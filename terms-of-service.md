If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this service. The materials provided through this platform are protected by applicable copyright and trademark laws.

## 2. Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) from this website for personal, non-commercial, and transitory viewing only. This is a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

- Modify or copy the materials;
- Use the materials for any commercial purpose or public display (commercial or non-commercial);
- Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software provided;
- Remove any copyright or proprietary notices from the materials; or
- Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by the service provider at any time. Upon termination, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession, whether in electronic or printed form.

## 3. Disclaimer

The materials provided on this platform are offered "as is." The service provider makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and disclaims all other warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other rights.

The provider does not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or outcomes from using the materials, nor is it responsible for content on linked websites.

## 4. Limitations

In no event shall the service provider or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising from the use or inability to use the materials, even if the provider has been notified of the possibility of such damage. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so these may not apply to you.

## 5. Accuracy of Materials

The materials presented on this website may include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. The provider does not warrant that any material is accurate, complete, or current. The provider may make changes to the materials at any time without notice but does not commit to updating them.

## 6. Links

The provider has not reviewed all websites linked to this platform and is not responsible for their contents. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement. Use of any linked site is at the user's own risk.

## 7. Modifications

The provider may revise these Terms of Service at any time without notice. By using this website, you agree to be bound by the then-current version of these terms.

## 8. Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction chosen by the service provider, and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in that region.
